Current/Emerging Trends
This project was about machine learning, specifically the Q-Learning algorithm. We were given the majority of the core methods that controlled the maze and game experience, and additionally we were given the code to build the maze in memory. However, we were tasked with creating the loop which played the game. We had to look at our given methods to determine how they are used and then incorporate them in such a way that the agent would be able to find the treasure. This included creating a method that allowed the agent to explore and replay then record the win or lose record.

In my opinion computer scientists are individuals who do scientific research with computers, and they are important to the scientific field in general as scientists, unlike normal developers concern themselves with the bigger problems out there such as designing machine learning algorithms, and tackling how to address problems that cannot currently be solved with the tools we have today.

I think approaching a problem as a computer scientist is not much different than how other scientific fields approach problems. That is to say once a problem is found the scientist will look at it in a methodical way, such as experimenting, testing and referring to other academic work as ways of coming up with a solution to the problem.

My ethical responsibilities are to make sure that machine learning algorithms are as fair and unbiased as possible. We need to make sure that new technologies introduced in the world do not cause harm to others and only help people. This can be done by making sure that any training data is free of bias and that all regulations and safeguards are being followed.
